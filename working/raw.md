Fall Bible Study
Prospect and Northwest UMC will join together for our Fall Bible Study. We will be exploring Anatomy of a Revived Church: Seven Findings about How Congregations Avoided Death written by Thom S. Rainer, founder and CEO of Church Answers and a former pastor with nearly 40 years of ministry experience. In this book, Rainer explores how churches can avoid closure by embracing change, strengthening leadership, engaging their communities, and fostering a culture of prayer and unity. Each chapter ends with questions for prayerful consideration and each chapter is filled with scripture.

This Bible study will be offered on three separate days

Tuesdays, Sep 30-Nov 11, 10-11 a.m. at Northwest UMC, led by Pastor Melissa Engel.
Wednesdays, Oct 1-Nov 12, 5:30-6:30 p.m. at Prospect UMC, led by Pastor Melissa Engel.
Thursdays, Oct 2-Nov 13, 10-11 a.m. at Prospect UMC, led by Lyn Bevill.

Home»About Us

About Us
Here at Northwest United Methodist Church, we rejoice in the life-giving, life-changing power of God in Jesus Christ. Many of us are not native to the Peoria area but have found a local “family” here at Northwest. Our greatest strength as a congregation lies in the loving support we give to each other in good times and bad.

Our mission at Northwest:

To experience and share the love and power of Jesus Christ.

As part of The United Methodist Church, our mission is to make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. Northwest United Methodist Church endeavors to fulfill our mission through worship, prayer, study, fellowship, community outreach, missional giving and service.

We invite you to join us on Sunday mornings at 9:45 as we worship God through prayer, scripture, a blend of contemporary and traditional music, and a message of hope and promise. Adult Sunday School meets prior to worship at 8:30, and Children’s Church is at 10:00.

Our Heritage

Northwest United Methodist Church is the result of a new church development begun by the then named Central Illinois Annual Conference in 1977. In January of 1978, under the leadership of Pastor Phil Meagher, the church was consecrated as the Peoria Northwest United Methodist Church. Although worshipping in a local store front, the charter members and friends held in common incredible hopes and dreams of a church that would one day impact the community in a huge way.

In 1979, with the help of many other local congregations, construction began on a parcel of recently purchased land alongside State Route 150 in what was then called “rural” Peoria County. In March 1981, Bishop Leroy Hodapp consecrated the church’s new home.

During the 1990’s the congregation undertook its first major building expansion which was intended to increase the number of Sunday School rooms, offices and sanctuary space, all in an attempt to handle the increasing number of families moving into the community. The expansion was completed in 2000 and quickly fulfilled its purposes as the church’s average attendance grew weekly.

Today, the church continues to serve the community and the world faithfully. As the number of ministries increases, the members increase in their witness and a solid focus on missions leads the way. At Northwest UMC there is much evidence that we serve a God who is very able and very faithful. And, the best is yet to come!

From the Pastor
A Little Love Note

What does it mean to insist on hope? For me, hope is more than just a wordy prayer. Hope is vulnerable and tender. It is fierce. It is something that can coexist with what we are experiencing. For some, this Advent and Christmas season may be filled with joy and contentment, while others could be nursing grief, loss, sadness, and fear. Our worship lineup, including Sunday services, the Wednesday services, and the Blue Christmas service, honors where you are this season. MaryAnn McKibben Dana, author of Hope: A User’s Manual, writes, “Hope invites us to cradle the past, rest in the present, and dream a beautiful future–however long it takes.” Hope never gives up. Hope is never finished. I find that comforting and inspiring. Comforting because it feels like “love never fails” in 1 Cor 13. Hope is enduring. Hope is inspiring for me because I can join that legacy of God’s people opening themselves to God’s grace and love and allowing God to heal the world through my life. How do you respond to the idea that “hope is never finished”? Is that daunting or is it comforting to you?

There is no right answer. There’s just where you are right now. Advent blessings to you all!

Love,

Pastor Melissa

Missions
hands-skyWe at Northwest are strongly committed to supporting those who have dedicated their lives to missionary work. Truly they are the hands and feet of Christ, honoring the Great Commission put forth by Jesus: “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28: 19-20)

We support a number of missions with monetary contributions and in prayer. In addition to our Faith Promise program of raising funds from congregation members, we also hold a number of fundraising events throughout the year to provide material support to these missions.

Here is a list of the missions we support and where to find more information:

* [Waves of Mercy](http://mercysaves.org/) (Larry & Diana Owen) – Haiti
* [Northwest Haiti Christian Mission](http://nwhcm.org/) (Jody & Jose Castillo) – Haiti
* [Child Restoration International](http://www.childrestoration.com/) (Brenda Lewis) – India
